#### Note
Before continuing make sure that git is installed on your machine!!
There are plenty of resources out there such as...

- [This Simple Blog](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
- [or This 20 Minuet Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Clau1bYco)

While both are helpful tutorials, you might run into some problems. If so you are more than welcome to stop by our [Slack channel](https://pymavs.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDU2MzEwODEyMjE1LWQ1MzcxOTgwNDMwOWVlY2U3MTJjNjIzZGYyNjQxZDgwMTVjOGEwMzNiZjcxYTgxNDE5NWQ4NGVkNjM0MWY4OTI) for some one on one help.


### First Things first
#### Downloading the Code
Before we can downloads a copy of PyMavs websites to mess with it, we need to fork the repository located at the top right of the [page](https://github.com/PyMavs/pymavs.github.io). In otherwords, we are creating a copy of the [Websites Code](https://github.com/PyMavs/pymavs.github.io) onto your
own Github account, allowing you to freely experiement with the code. With a fork you can change anything you want on your copy and when you are ready you can submit a pull request.
